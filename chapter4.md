# Chapter 4: Advanced Git Techniques and Workflows 🔧

## Advanced Git Techniques

### 4.1 Interactive Rebasing ♻️
- Interactive rebasing allows you to modify and organize your commit history.
- Use `git rebase -i [commit]` to open the interactive rebase tool.
- Reorder, edit, squash, or drop commits as needed.

### 4.2 Git Stash 🗃️
- Stashing temporarily saves changes without committing them.
- Helpful when you need to switch branches or apply changes later.
- `git stash`, `git stash save`, and `git stash apply`.

### 4.3 Git Cherry-Pick 🍒
- Cherry-picking allows you to select and apply specific commits to another branch.
- Useful for picking individual changes from one branch to another.
- `git cherry-pick [commit]`.

## Advanced Workflows

### 4.4 Git Flow Workflow 🔄
- A branching model for structured development.
- Defines branches for features, releases, and hotfixes.
- Enhances collaboration and release management.

### 4.5 GitHub Actions 🎬
- Automate workflows and tasks with GitHub Actions.
- CI/CD pipelines, testing, and more.
- `.github/workflows` directory.

## Customizing Git Configuration

### 4.6 Git Aliases ⚡
- Create shortcuts for common Git commands.
- Simplify your workflow with custom aliases.
- Examples: `git config --global alias.co checkout`.

### 4.7 Git Hooks 🔗
- Execute custom scripts on Git events.
- Pre-commit, post-commit, and more.
- Customize your Git workflow.
