# Chapter 1: Introduction to Git and GitHub

## Git Basics

### What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It's used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

### Basic Git Commands

- `git clone [url]`: Clone a repository into a new directory.
- `git add [file]`: Add a file to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "[commit message]"`: Commit changes with a message.
- `git push [alias] [branch]`: Push your changes to the remote repository.
- `git pull [alias] [branch]`: Update your local repository to the newest commit from the remote server.

## Introduction to GitHub

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It provides a graphical interface and access control to several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
